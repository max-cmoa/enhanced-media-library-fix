# Enhanced Media Library Fix
  This repo contains a fix for the Enhanced Media Library. This issue was that when
  going to (Pages -> Add Media -> Upload Files) the area of Drop files to upload or Select
  Files was not showing up. This repo fixes that problem.

The original Enhanced Media Library Plugin can be found here: <ins>https://wordpress.org/plugins/enhanced-media-library/</ins>
